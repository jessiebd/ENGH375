<h1>Educational Experience</h1>
<p>I have an Associates Degree in Pyschology
from Northern Virginia Community College, and I am currently pursuing
a Bachelor's Degree in English Literature, as well as a minor
in Technical Writing here at Mason.</p>
<p>In my time at school, I have taken many classes, but some of my favorites include:
<ul>
    <li>ENGH 486: Writing Nonfiction for the Public</li>
    <li>ENGH 388: Professional and Technical Writing</li>
    <li>ENGH 380: Introduction to Writing and Rhetoric</li>
    <li>SPA 101-SPA 202</li>
</ul>
<p> Overall, I really enjoy learning and discussing information as a group.</p>
