    <h1>Career Goals</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jessica Davis, and I am a senior at George Mason University. 
Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, with a concentration in Literature, as well as a Minor in Technical Writing. 
I plan to pursue techincal writing internships for the following summer if at all possible. I am particularly interested in proposal writing!
My goal in this endeavor is to become a cohesive and skilled team member and technical writer.
At this moment in my educational career, I am striving to learn, develop, and broaden my professional and technical writing abilities.   </p>
